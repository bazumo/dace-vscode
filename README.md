# SDFV in VS Code

This VS Code extension aims to provide a viewing panel for
[SDFGs](http://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/Research/DAPP/) inside of VS Code. It
serves as a wrapper for the SDFG Viewer SDFV, found in the current version
of [DaCe](https://github.com/spcl/dace).

## Features

Provides an SDFG viewing panel which:
- opens to the side automatically, when you open up a valid SDFG file
  (file ending in `.sdfg`, JSON formatted).
- Always updates to show the last looked at SDFG.
- Auto-updates the SDFG Viewer when the file is saved from within VS Code.
